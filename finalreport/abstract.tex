In academia, citation networks are often used to evaluate the quality of a professor\textquoteright~s research output. Since people expect to be compensated based on the value of their work, we should expect a correlation between research output and academic salary. Using citation networks, we can quantify the productivity of a professor in a number of different ways. Does a specific model of productivity correspond to academic salary better than others? We look at 18 years of citation networks in theoretical high energy physics, and investigate the correlation between seniority, different models of productivity, and academic salary. Using straightforward citation count, we find that there is a correlation between productivity and salary. We also find a strong correlation between seniority and salary. Our results show that more complicated notions of productivity does not correspond well with academic salary, and we discuss why these measures are inadequate for assessing the change in productivity.
